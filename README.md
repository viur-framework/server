# ViUR server

This is the core component of **ViUR**, a free software development framework for the [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com) written in [Python](https://python.org/).

## About

ViUR provides a clear concept for implementing agile data management software. Its underlying database is Googles Cloud Datastore, which is a scalable document database.

The ViUR framework caters to the implementation of information systems, that are integrated, web-based applications or services performing data management and deployment operations of any kind. Therefore, ViUR is explicitly not advertised as a content management system, although content management can be a part of a ViUR information system.

## Getting started
