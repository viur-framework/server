# Changelog

This file documents any relevant changes done to ViUR server since version 2.

## [develop]

### Added
- Utility functions `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` to provide a JavaScript-style string value parsing


## [2.2.0 Etna] - 2018-04-23

### Added
- A new Rate-Limit module that can be used to prevent DoS / Brute-Force on certain resources.
- New keyBone() class introduced for a better distinction between bones containing an entity key and those which don't.

### Changed
- Return descriptions in selectBones translated from our json render
- More descriptive error messages returned from password bone
- The new "params" Parameter introduced in 2.1.0 should now always have a default value (None)
- *[Breaking]*: Merged *selectOneBone* and *selectMultiBone* into a single *selectBone* which supports the multiple flag,
  the previous bone names are still supported and cause a deprecation warning in the logs.

### Fixed
- v2.2.1: Fixed bug in baseBone.buildDBFilter() relating to lt/gt/lk operators
- Resolving the name of skeletons in prototypes/hierarchy when used on multi-lang bones
- Unserializing of booleanBones failed if the database contained a unicode string
- Several errors caused by None returned from getSearchDocumentFields / getSearchTags
- Exception causing ``toDB()`` to fail if a bone should be serialized which isn't in the valuesCache object. Fixes #7.
- Prevent text/string Bones from restoring old (non-multilang data) if set back to empty values. Fixes #6.
- Use urlsafe_b64decode for filename decoding (used by some old IE on WinXP). Fixes #38.
- Prevent skeleton from the server to take precedence over the ones defined in the application.
- The indexed-flag had been ignored on edit - causing all fields to be indexed. Fixes #34.

### Added
 - New edit form templates following the ViUR ignite standard
 - Pass the error description of HTTPException to the underlying webob framework

 - userBones with creation- or update-magic set are not forced to be invisible anymore
 - Don't set skel["key"] to None if skel.delete() is called
 - Relational bones can now include properties from ref-/rel-skel bones in search indexes
 - Setting update- or creation-magic on userBones don't force them to be invisible anymore
 - *[Breaking]* Internal representation of relations are now dicts, not instances of Ref- or Rel-Skels

### Fixed
 - handle ValueError in int() or float() in numericBone:buildDbFilter
 - serializing a textBone failing in getSearchDocumentFields if valuesCache[name] is None
 - Correctly handle None values in numericBones getSearchDocumentFields()
 - Added missing imports to dbtransfer.py
 - Several issues with writing search api indexes for relationalBones
 - Usage of old Skeleton-API in orders module
 - Users without access to the vi/admin render couldn't logout using these renders
